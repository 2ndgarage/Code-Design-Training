<h4 id="implement-option-3.list-movies">1. Implement option <em>3. List Movies</em></h4>
<h4 id="implement-option-4.find-movies">2. Implement option <em>4. Find Movies</em></h4>
<h4 id="integrate-the-servicelocator-into-the-app">3. Integrate the <code>ServiceLocator</code> into the app</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make one of the implementation get its dependencies through the static ServiceLocator.Current</li>
<li>Get the IServiceLocator through Dependency Injection in one of your classes</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="implement-the-console-options-as-a-set-of-commands-registered-into-unity-container">4. Implement the console options as a set of commands registered into Unity Container</h4>
<p>All the commands could implement an <code>ICommand</code> interface (you could use (or gent inspired from) the interface from the <code>System.Windows.Input</code>)</p>
<p>Implement a class <code>Menu</code> that finds all <code>ICommand</code> implementations and displays the menu with them. When a menu entry is picked, it will execute that command by calling the <code>Execute()</code> function.</p>
<p>The console app should discover all available commands, build the menu with them and then execute them based on the user input</p>
